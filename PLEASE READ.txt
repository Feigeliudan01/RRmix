Dear Professors & Mahya,

I hope all is well.  Due to some issues with CMAIL, I have uploaded everything to this new Dropbox folder,
and included my email as this note.  I have in this folder an initial draft of the RRmix R package and 
documentation.  I have left the package description and details blank for now, as I was unsure as to the 
final state that the package would take.  In addition, I left an open reference section for the dataset we 
used in the paper.  Attached to this email is:

- A PDF of the R manual for this package (RRmix.PDF)
- The source package to be imported into R (RRmix_1.0.tar.gz)
- The binary package (RRmix_1.0.zip)
- The RStudio project directory that I created to work on this package (RRmix.zip)

Is there a time that everyone would be free, perhaps early next week, to go over everything and make any 
necessary edits to the documentation/functionality of the package, as well as to discuss the paper and next 
steps?

Best,
Steve
